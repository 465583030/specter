# Specter

Specter is an implementation of [GenTiradentes' TinyVM][tvm] in Go (the original is written in C).

This is very much to learn about virtual machines (this is my first attempt at a VM, so huge thanks to GenTiradentes for making a minimal one, easy to grasp).

At the moment it runs all examples available in TinyVM's repository, but it performs poorly compared to the original. Next step is to attempt some optimizations.
